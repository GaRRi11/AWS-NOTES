## ‚úÖ CORE CLOUD CONCEPTS

### üì¶ Virtualization Layers
1. **PHYSICAL SERVER** - real machine  
2. **COMPUTE RESOURCES** - CPU, RAM  
3. **STORAGE RESOURCES** - HDD/SSD  
4. **HYPERVISOR** - creates/manages virtual machines  
5. **VIRTUAL MACHINES (VMs)** - your "servers"

üí° Virtualization is the heart of cloud computing. It allows multiple VMs on one physical server.

### üìà Cloud Benefits

| Term        | Meaning                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability** | Add more servers if demand increases (like auto-creating VMs). Used in Auto Scaling. |
| **Elasticity**  | Remove extra servers when demand drops to save money.                 |

### EC2 has access to storage, memory, and network interface. Its primary storage drive will come with a fresh and clean operating system.

You choose hardware resources, the OS, and software stack.

Hardware specs (CPU, network, memory, primary storage) ‚Üê all of those are defined before launching.

The OS is defined by the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you choose.

---

## AMI ‚Äì Amazon Machine Image

An AMI is a pre-configured template used to launch EC2 instances with a specific OS and software.

**Amazon Quick Start AMIs üöÄ** ‚Äì Pre-built AMIs by AWS to quickly deploy popular software and architectures following best practices.  
‚Üí Linux, Windows, macOS Server OSs.  
‚Üí Also available: deep learning, database operations, etc.

**AWS Marketplace AMIs üõí** ‚Äì Pre-configured AMIs sold or shared by third-party vendors through AWS Marketplace for easy deployment of software solutions.

**Community AMIs üåç** ‚Äì Free AMIs shared by other AWS users.  
‚Üí Most of them are created and maintained by independent vendors.

**Private AMIs üîí** ‚Äì AMIs created by you or your organization, visible only to selected AWS accounts.

Particular AMIs will be available in single regions.  
You get billed hourly when using certain paid AMI software.

---

## EC2 Instance Type Families

### General Purpose ‚öñÔ∏è 
Balanced compute, memory, and networking.  
‚Üí Web servers, small databases, development environments.

### Compute Optimized üíª
High-performance CPUs for compute-heavy tasks.  
‚Üí Gaming servers, batch processing, scientific modeling.

### Memory Optimized üíæ 
More RAM for memory-intensive applications.  
‚Üí In-memory databases, real-time big data analytics, caching.

### Accelerated Computing üöÄ 
Uses GPUs or FPGAs for specialized workloads.  
‚Üí Machine learning, video processing, scientific simulations.

### Storage Optimized üíΩ 
High-speed, high-capacity storage.  
‚Üí Big data processing, data warehousing, large NoSQL databases.

---

## CONFIGURING AN ENVIRONMENT FOR YOUR INSTANCE

Before launching an EC2 instance, decide:

### Region (where your server lives) üåé
AWS has data centers in different parts of the world, called regions.

‚Üí Choose a region close to your users or one that meets legal requirements (like data laws).  
‚Üí You can only manage EC2 resources within the region you're currently using.

**Set the active region**:  
‚Üí Console (top-right dropdown)  
‚Üí CLI: `aws configure`

Costs and available features can differ between regions.

### VPC (your network space) üåê
A VPC is your own private network inside AWS.

‚Üí Use different VPCs for different project stages:  
‚Ä¢ Development  
‚Ä¢ Testing  
‚Ä¢ Production  

Example: Dev team updates `api.myapp.com` in the Dev VPC EC2, but Test and Prod teams don‚Äôt see the change because they use separate EC2 instances in isolated VPCs.

Basic VPCs (without NAT or VPN) are free.

---

### Tenancy (shared or dedicated hardware) üñ•Ô∏è

**Shared Tenancy (default) üèòÔ∏è** ‚Äì Your instance runs on a physical server shared with other people too.  
‚Üí It's secure. You don‚Äôt see or interact with others‚Äô instances.

**Dedicated Tenancy üíé** ‚Äì Costs more.

- **Dedicated Instances** ‚Üí Your EC2 instance runs on a physical server not shared with other AWS customers.
- **Dedicated Hosts üè†** ‚Üí Same isolation as Dedicated Instances, plus you know and control the exact physical server used.

---

### User Data (Bootstrapping) üß∞

A script you can attach to the instance to execute automatically during launch.

E.g., Automatically install software when EC2 starts.  
You can define it through the **Console, CLI, or CloudFormation templates**.

Example: For installing an Nginx server:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum install -y nginx
service nginx start
